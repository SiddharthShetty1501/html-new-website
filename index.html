        <h2>What is Geoengineering?</h2>
        <p>Climate engineering or climate intervention, commonly referred to as geoengineering, is the deliberate and large-scale intervention in the Earth's climate system, usually with the aim of mitigating and counter-acting the effects of global warming!</p>
        <h2>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h2>

        <h2>So when will we use geoengineering?</h2>
        <p>It will be used in the near future when it is the last resort to sort out climate change. We will use it when our world leaders fail to address climate change and the world may increasingly look to geoengineering in the wake of the latest UN climate report, which says it could be adopted as a temporary ‚Äúremedial measure‚Äù if the world heads towards dangerous levels of global warming!</p>
        <h2>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h2>

        <h2>Who is responsible for climate change?</h2>
        <p>Tens of thousands of scientists in more than a hundred nations have amassed an overwhelming amount of evidence pointing to a clear conclusion: Humans are the main cause. We are the ones who burn fossil fuels, produce livestock and clear trees, increasing the number of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere.</p>

        <h2>How can geoengineering fix human impacts on the atmosphere?</h2>
        <p>Geoengineering methods are intended to reduce climate change, which is already having demonstrable effects on ecosystem structure and functioning in some regions. Current research suggests that SRM or CDR might diminish the impacts of climate change on ecosystems by reducing changes in temperature and precipitation.</p>
        <h2>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h2>

        <h2>Enough with the morbid stuff, so what can me and you do as a society?</h2>
        <p>Firstly you can battle rapid climate change by eating season fruits. Yes you heard me ,eat seasonal fruits as the others are transported by vehicle (more emissions). Set up a compost system for your food scraps, or find a food scrap drop off centre (like a farmers market, or community garden) near your house. Lastly you can host or join a waterway cleanup in your local community. Keep those waters plastic free!</p>

        <h2>Survey Results for Geoengineering:</h2>
        <p>I recently conducted a survey about Geoengineering! Here are the results to my research questions at the start of the journey!</p>
        <h2>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h2>

        <img src="question 1 and 2.png"
        width="30%" height="30%">

        <p>Pretty interesting right? People actually feel like Geoengineering will actually work! Moreover, people out there are aware of Geoengineering as a whole! Other research groups such as First international surveyed on the perception of geoengineering and found 72% of respondents approve of research and development!</p>
        <h2>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h2>

        <img src="question 3 and 4.png"
        width="30%" height="30%">

        <p>Wow! The society also feels that Geoengineering will be a path of climate salvation. Adding onto that, everyone understood what Geoengineering was and its applications.  Support for geoengineering is spread across the political spectrum and is linked to support for science concern about climate change. The strongest opposition comes from people who self-identify as politically conservative, who are distrustful of government and other elite institutions, and who doubt the very idea that there is a climate problem. Pretty interesting huh?</p>
        <h2>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h2>

        <img src="Question 5.png"
        width="30%" height="30%">

        <p>It seems like our responders know how to battle climate change! Very impressive! As I listed above, the responses have covered all the actions you can take. We‚Äôd need to spread the world‚Äôs best climate practices globally ‚Äî like electric cars in Norway, energy efficiency in California, land protection in Costa Rica, solar and wind power in China, vegetarianism in India, bicycle use in the Netherlands!</p>

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>I feel like (siding with science here) Geoengineering is the only solution to reduce climate change. Though I hope we never use it, we need more time ‚Äì and solar geoengineering is the only practical way to give us that time. The society needs to work together to develop our technical innovations to a point where there are no flaws and we can consider to change the climate according to our needs.I hope you enjoyed reading this website and all the information in it!
